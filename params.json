{"name":"Tabbed","tagline":"A HTML/CSS/JS approach to tabs with reordering and drag between containers.","body":"## tabbed - Chrome Tabs\r\n\r\n### About\r\nThe project with the very simple name \"tabbed\" tries to come up with yet another tab interface. Why another one, one might ask.\r\nWell, first of all the approach taken here emulates the look and feel of tabs as seen in the Google Chrome browser. Rounded edges, overlapping tabs, shadows, eventually even the mouse position dependent gradient will be implemented.\r\nIn addition, I'm trying to achieve something which is not available in other toolkits: the tabs should be allowed to be dragged between different bars. It's even possible to establish new containers with a simple drag. In theory, it would be even possible to manage different types of containers on one site, using only one script. Ain't that something?\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\nA demo of the initial (and current) state of the project can be found here: http://zemion.github.io/tabbed/demo/\r\nTry and create new tabs, drag them out to establish new containers, and drag tabs between them. Many things unfortunately aren't supported yet. But it's a start, isn't it?\r\n\r\n### Current status\r\nThe code provided is published \"as is\". While loving to code, my spare time is limited. That's why there is currently only one demo on github (http://zemion.github.io/tabbed/demo), nothing to customize, even no documentation or comments in the source code. But I'll get to that! Check back regularily for updates et cetera.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nThe project was initialized and is currently developed and maintained by Albrecht Degering (@zemion).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nFor problems, support, ideas and questions of any kind, feel free to contact me via github.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
